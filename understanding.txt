Step 1: 
- Analyse the Data
	- 100 train images each of 128x128 dimension JPEG
	- test images are of different dimensions but should match in scale
- Add support for visualising the data using graphs and image sample dumps


Step 2: List the things to try out
- Create a end to end system:
	- ability to train input
	- ability to adapt to different models and experiment
	- ability to modify and iterate 
	- run the trained model for all the test cases
- TensorFlow and Keras Implementation
- Different models to tryout: segmentation: FCN, U-Net,
- Custom model which tries to learn the optimum filter for the solution by changing the filters adaptively


For remote system:
- Ability to upload train data via link, file etc
- Ability to review the train/test data
	- Ability to get basic stats from the train data
	- filenames and basic image dimensions etc
- 

Python packages:
- scikit-learn, keras (theano/tensorflow), hdf5,
